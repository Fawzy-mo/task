<h1><span>About</span> Black</h1>
<p>Black was one of the first colors used by artists in neolithic cave paintings.
It was used in ancient Egypt and Greece as the color of the underworld.<br>
In the Roman Empire, it became the color of mourning, and over the centuries it was frequently associated with death, evil.<br>
Black ink is the most common color used for printing books,and newspapers,<br>
 as it provides the highest contrast with white paper and thus the easiest color to read</p>
